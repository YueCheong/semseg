# HOI4D Semantic segmentation challenge
Please check out the HOI4D Challenge on the latest project website www.hoi4d.top !
## Overview
This code base provides a benchmark for the HOI4D challenge Semantic segmentation task, and we provide the training code for two models, P4Transformer and PPTr.
## Challege
For this challege, you need submmit a pred.npy file(your predicted results) to the leaderboard. The file pred.npy is a ndarray:(892, 300, 8192) which is the prediction of test_wolabel.h5.
You can download the example here: [Link](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApQF_e_bw-USgjQCKg9hGJIijeqs?e=eGfohd)
## Install
These packages are needed:
```
torch
numpy
torchvision
```
This code is also based on the environment of pointnet++, so you should install it using following command:
```
cd ./modules
pip install .
```
## Usage
You can reproduce the result of PPTr or P4Transformer using:
```
python train_pptr.py --output-dir ./output
python train_p4.py --output-dir ./output
```
